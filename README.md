# Mnesweeper
This is a fully functional implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework in C++. The game features dynamic gameplay where users can select the difficulty and play on a grid of different sizes, ranging from 10x10 to 30x30. The objective is to clear the grid without triggering bombs.
